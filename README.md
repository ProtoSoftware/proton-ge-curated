This repository houses releases from https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom repackaged in a way that supports usage with Proto.

All builds uploaded are not modified in any way other than being decompressed and recompressed in the `tar.xz` format alongside a `.sha512sum` file. If they are already uploaded as a `.tar.xz` they are just reuploaded here directly. 

All releases are automatically fetched every 24 hours from the main repository, once this happens a repackaged build will be uploaded as soon as possible.
